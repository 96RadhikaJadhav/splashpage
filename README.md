# JuniorDev.io website

https://juniordev.io

JuniorDev.io contains info and links to all the chapters of JuniorDev around the world, and lets people sign up our newletters and give us more information about whether they're a front-end, back-end, or full-stack developer, and which state they live in.

PR's are welcome! So feel free to fork the repo above and get coding!
